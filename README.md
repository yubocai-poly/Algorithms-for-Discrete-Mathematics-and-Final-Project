# MAA205 - Algorithms for Discrete Mathematics
## Final Project - Numerical Algorithms for Analysis of Catalan Number
This is the github page of The final project for MAA205 - Algorithms for Discrete Mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique provided by Professor Lucas Gerin. The whole project is implemented through `Jupyter Notebook`. You can find the website of this project, sources code, pdf version of the project in the following link.

In this project, we focus on the properties and applications of Catalan number through numerical algorithms and analytical tools.

- **Chapter 2**, In this chapter we present the most intuitive algorithms for calculating the catalan number, for example by recursion, iteration or binomial formula, and their corresponding efficiency analysis.

- **Chapter 3**, In this part, we first compute the generating functions of catalan numbers and duduce the formula from the generating function. We will also introduce the method with Taylor expansion and compare the efficiency of these approaches. After we will discover Motzkin Numbers and its propositions.

- **Chapter 4**, Since the catalan numbers increase pretty fast, therefore in this chapter we try to have analysis using asymptotic analysis as well as algebraic means.

- **Chapter 5**, In the last chapter, we will discover some application in Combinatorial mathematics and some paths algorithmic problems.

## Course Content

This is the advanced course of MAA103-Discrete Mathematics and we trying to use programming to apply some algorithms in discrete mathematics.

### Reference
Here is a great textbook (available at Polytechnique's library) that covers the 3 lectures: [Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science. R.Graham, D.E.Knuth, O.Patashnik](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r97002/temp/Concrete%20Mathematics%202e.pdf).

However, this book is too broad. If you want to get to know this course more quickly. Here you can access the [github repository](https://github.com/yubocai-poly/Algorithms-for-Discrete-Mathematics), where the course is consist of Tutorial in Jupyter Notebook and Lecture. For lecture information you can find my lecture notes token from courses for each chapter from the link above.
