In this project, we focus on the properties and applications of Catalan number through numerical algorithms and analytical tools.

- **Chapter 2**, In this chapter we present the most intuitive algorithms for calculating the catalan number, for example by recursion, iteration or binomial formula, and their corresponding efficiency analysis.

- **Chapter 3**, In this part, we first compute the generating functions of catalan numbers and duduce the formula from the generating function. We will also introduce the method with Taylor expansion and compare the efficiency of these approaches. After we will discover Motzkin Numbers and its propositions.

- **Chapter 4**, Since the catalan numbers increase pretty fast, therefore in this chapter we try to have analysis using asymptotic analysis as well as algebraic means.

- **Chapter 5**, In the last chapter, we will discover some application in Combinatorial mathematics and some paths algorithmic problems.
